    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 oz) package of lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 lb of ground beef (75% lean)</li>
        <li>3 (15 oz) cans of tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 (6 oz) can of tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 tsp garlic salt</li>
        <li>5 tbsp italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 pint (15 oz) ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups of shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In a large cooking pot cook lasagna noodles in boiling salted (to taste) water until al dente -
            i.e. nearly fully cooked but we want to avoid the noodle being too soft - it should feel "thick"
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large sauce pan brown the ground beef. Drain excess grease, then combine with tomato sauces and
            paste, simmering until the sauce is bubbly. Add garlic salt and italian seasoning, reducing heat
            to a low simmer. Cook for 10 more minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            To assemble, in the bottom of a 13x9 inch baking dish spread a thin layer of sauce. Then add a layer
            of noodles, ricotta cheese, sauce/ground beef mixture, and then grated mozzarella cheese. Repeat until
            baking dish is filled. Garnish top with additional shredded mozzarella cheese as desired.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a preheated 375 degree oven bake for 30 minutes or until bubbly. Let stand for 15 minutes.
        </li>
